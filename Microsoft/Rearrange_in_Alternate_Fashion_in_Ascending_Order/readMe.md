## Given an array of integers (both odd and even), the task is to arrange them in such a way that odd and even values come in alternate fashion in non-decreasing order(ascending) respectively.

- If the smallest value is Even then we have to print Even-Odd pattern.
- If the smallest value is Odd then we have to print Odd-Even pattern.
Note: No. of odd elements must be equal to No. of even elements in the input array.

```
Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 10}
Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 7
Smallest value is 1(Odd) so output will be Odd-Even pattern.

Input: arr[] = {9, 8, 13, 2, 19, 14}
Output: 2, 9, 8, 13, 14, 19
Smallest value is 2(Even) so output will be Even-Odd pattern.
```
