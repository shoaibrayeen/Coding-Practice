## Given two integers n and m. The problem is to find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there are more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value. If n is completely divisible by m, then output n only. Time complexity of O(1) is required.

Constraints: m != 0

```

Input : n = 13, m = 4
Output : 12

Input : n = -15, m = 6
Output : -18
Both -12 and -18 are closest to -15, but
-18 has the maximum absolute value.
```
