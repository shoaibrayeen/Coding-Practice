## Given a string of consecutive digits and a number Y, the task is to find the number of minimum sets such that every set follows the below rule:

- Set should contain consecutive numbers
- No digit can be used more than once.
- The number in the set should not be more than Y.

```
Input: s = "1234", Y = 30  
Output: 3

Three sets of {12, 3, 4}  


Input: s = "1234", Y = 4 
Output: 4
Four sets of {1}, {2}, {3}, {4} 
```
